#Quick Note:
#We used the 'random' library to generate a random guess.
#function guess_number is used to perform the task.
#'while not' loop gives the user multiple chances until they succeed.
#'if-else' statements make this program a bit more interactive.
#This program adds a playful twist by having the program suggest its own random guess, making the game more interactive.
#If the user guesses the program's number but it's not correct, a humorous message is displayed to keep the user engaged.
#The playful comments and teasing add an element of fun to the guessing game, making it more entertaining.
